BUGLOG:

Checkpoint 1:

1) system crashed
	Problem: IDT entries were set to absent
	Fix: we set the IDT entries to present

2) system crashed when we included paging.h in kernel.c
	Problem: we accessed the wrong memory location for initializing the page for video memory
	Fix: changed VIDEO_MEM from 0xB8 to 0xB8000

3) RTC not working
	Problem: IDT was not set properly
	Fix: added .size and .reserved4

4) interrupt wrapper would crash during iret
	Problem: stack was unbalanced
	Fix: instead of manually pushing all registers in the common_interrupt we added a pushal in each individual interrupt handler

Checkpoint 2:

1) keyboard interrupts were not going through
	Problem: keyboard was not connected to IDT or PIC
	Fix: connected the keyboard to the IDT, then re-wrote the PIC
		 enable_irq and disable_irq as it was hard-coded for the RTC only

2) buffer was adding double characters (ex. hheelllloo)
	Problem: buffer was taking in characters with both the press and release
	Fix: removed duplicate code which added characters into the buffer, and added an if check for the scancodes before we added it in the buffer

3) buffer was incorrect after we backspaced (it added \00), and after we hit enter, the backspace was still going to the previous line
	Problem: indexing issue
	Fix: fixed the indexing issue

4) page faulting every time I accessed the boot_block
	Problem: the FILESYS_ADDR was hardcoded
	Fix: created a global variable and initialized it with mod->mod_start

5) page faulting while printing file_type or inode_num of dentry
	Problem: I used %s in a printf statement to print a uint32_t data type (file_type and inode_num)
	Fix: I changed it to %d

6) page faulting in read_data when I accessed the length or data_blocks of inode_ptr
	Problem: inode struct was not initialized correctly
	Fix: initialized inode_ptr->length and inode_ptr->data_blocks

7) page faulting while initializing the data_block_ptr
	Problem: was dereferencing the pointer in intialization
	Fix: did not dereference the address

8) page faulting in read_data memcpy
	Problem: data_block_ptr is out of bounds
	Fix:
